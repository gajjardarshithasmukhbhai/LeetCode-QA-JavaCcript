### Euclidean Distance Concepts

## Overview

The Euclidean distance measures the straight-line distance between two points in a Euclidean space. It is derived from the Pythagorean theorem and is widely used in mathematics, computer science, machine learning, and other fields.

## Formula

### 2D Space:

For two points \( P = (x_1, y_1) \) and \( Q = (x_2, y_2) \):

\[
d(P, Q) = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]

### n-Dimensional Space:

For points \( P = (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) \) and \( Q = (y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n) \):

\[
d(P, Q) = \sqrt{\sum\_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - x_i)^2}
\]

---

## Steps to Calculate

1. Subtract the corresponding coordinates of the two points.
2. Square each difference.
3. Sum all squared differences.
4. Take the square root of the sum.

## Examples

### 2D Example

For \( P = (3, 4) \) and \( Q = (6, 8) \):

\[
d(P, Q) = \sqrt{(6 - 3)^2 + (8 - 4)^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5
\]

### 3D Example

For \( P = (1, 2, 3) \) and \( Q = (4, 6, 8) \):

\[
d(P, Q) = \sqrt{(4 - 1)^2 + (6 - 2)^2 + (8 - 3)^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16 + 25} = \sqrt{50} \approx 7.07
\]

## Applications

1. **Machine Learning**: Used in algorithms like k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) to find the closest data points.
2. **Clustering**: Determines similarity between data points in clustering algorithms like k-means.
3. **Computer Vision**: Compares feature vectors for image and pattern recognition.
4. **Robotics**: Calculates shortest paths and distances in navigation.
5. **Statistics**: Measures similarity between data points in multidimensional analysis.

---

## Key Properties

1. **Non-negative**: Distance is always \( \geq 0 \).
2. **Symmetry**: \( d(P, Q) = d(Q, P) \).
3. **Identity of Indiscernibles**: \( d(P, Q) = 0 \) if and only if \( P = Q \).
4. **Triangle Inequality**: \( d(P, R) \leq d(P, Q) + d(Q, R) \).

## Code Implementation

### JavaScript Example

```javascript
function euclideanDistance(point1, point2) {
  if (point1.length !== point2.length) {
    throw new Error("Points must have the same dimension");
  }

  const squaredDifferences = point1.map((p1, index) => {
    const p2 = point2[index];
    return Math.pow(p2 - p1, 2);
  });

  return Math.sqrt(squaredDifferences.reduce((sum, val) => sum + val, 0));
}

// Examples
console.log(euclideanDistance([3, 4], [6, 8])); // Output: 5
console.log(euclideanDistance([1, 2, 3], [4, 6, 8])); // Output: ~7.07
```

---

## Notes

- Ensure points have the same dimensions before calculating the distance.
- The Euclidean distance works only in a flat (non-curved) space. For curved spaces, other distance metrics like geodesic distance should be used.
